    <meta name="description" content="When it comes to creating the perfect profile to most it feels more like a selling pitch or a job interview! Sounds cringe worthy, we know but did you know one in three couples find love online and one in six marriages? And much to your dismay not having a well detailed out profile with little or no details is more likely to be overlooked than having a profile that shows your true personality, has the best photos displayed and reflects what you are looking for in a partner.
We all know it can be very scary when you first decide to try out online dating and even more daunting when you don&rsquo;t know how to create that amazing eye catching profile. So here are a few steps to help you on your way to creating the right profile for you on Hashtagdatme.
Add words that reflect you
When first signing up to hashtagdateme you will be asked to add hashtags that best describes you. Here you can be creative and put words that best describes you without the need of explaining your hobbies or writing a long essay. This allows you to keep things simple and interesting. Try to avoid using clich&eacute; words that are generic and everyone else is using. Instead put words that are catchy and describes you truly. Studies have shown words like funny outgoing optimistic physicallyfit yoga used by women have noticed more attention while men who use words like passionate spontaneous thoughtful funny skiing get more approaches. Even though you&rsquo;re probably thinking the word Funny is a bit clich&eacute; too, it is still widely used but scientist have found that both men and women are attracted to people who describe themselves as Funny. Of course this don&rsquo;t mean you should only stick to these words think of things that you feel is the true you. Even add words that describes your job title who knows there might be a potential match who works in the same sector. Putting down your hobbies and interest are a great conversation starter so think about what you want to say and enjoy yourself.
Write more about yourself in your own words
If you feel that the hashtags don&rsquo;t fully show your personality more in depth you can write more about yourself in the About Me section. We know this is the part where you feel that you have to really sell yourself. But as mentioned earlier a profile with hardly any information tends to be overlooked and the user will just move onto the next interesting profile. The whole point is to entice the user to make the approach of contacting you so you want to make your About Me section not too long or deep remember you want to attract the person not bore them to death! 
Try to avoid writing about what you aren&rsquo;t looking for this can be clearly stated for what you are looking for in the Hashtag describe what you are looking for section which we will cover in the next paragragh. The last thing anyone wants to do is read about you ranting about the so and so losers who contact you or how you make an X amount of lists of pros and cons of what you look for in an ideal partner.
It will only put the reader off as you will only come across as a moaner and negative. Here you want to just simply talk more a little about yourself and your lifestyle to your travel adventures. Just imagine you met someone for the first time what is it that you would say? Use that idea and write that in your profile. If you get stuck why not ask a close friend or relative to give you some pointers. We all know that friends and family always tell us their honest description of us, well in some cases! 
Try to keep your profile upbeat and people love funny why not put in a little joke or something that will make the person want to know you more or a great conversational starter is to ask a question in your profile to break the ice. Just adding that little bit of humour in your profile can make you come across approachable and friendly. Whatever you may put down in your About Me section make it unique and worth reading.
&nbsp;
Describe what you are looking for
The hashtag describing what I am looking for section is your domain. You are in full control of what it is you are looking for in a partner. This takes away from looking either too snobby or negative in your About Me section where most people tend to sway away from your profile if they read what they don&rsquo;t like. Here you can make your list of what you look for in a partner. Be specific and even hashtag words with topics that you are interested in and hobbies that would best describe your match. 
Be bold and honest in what it is you&rsquo;re looking for from the colour of the eye you are attracted to, to the number of pets they have or you want them to have!

Do not be afraid to put words of what you want or looking for as nothing is more attractive than someone who knows exactly what they want. When describing someone&rsquo;s character try not to be overly picky or you might come across superficial and rigid.
A photo tells a thousand stories
In this case a good photo attracts the most attention and even though some people might judge you solely on your photo, so why not give them something to talk about and upload a picture worth remembering. First impressions not only applies for meeting in person for the first time but also the kind of pictures you choose to upload. A few things to avoid is putting up dark and grainy photos that barely show your face this will just make the user swipe the picture &lsquo;Left&rsquo; nobody wants to be a leftswipey!

Sounds cringe worthy, we know but did you know one in three couples find love online and one in six marriages? And much to your dismay not having a well detailed out profile with little or no details is more likely to be overlooked than having a profile that shows your true personality, has the best photos displayed and reflects what you are looking for in a partner.</p>

Studies have shown words like <strong>funny outgoing optimistic physicallyfit</strong> <strong>yoga </strong>used by women have noticed more attention while men who use words like <strong>passionate spontaneous thoughtful funny skiing </strong>get more approaches. Even though you&rsquo;re probably thinking the word Funny is a bit clich&eacute; too, it is still widely used but scientist have found that both men and women are attracted to people who describe themselves as Funny. Of course this don&rsquo;t mean you should only stick to these words think of things that you feel is the true you. Even add words that describes your job title who knows there might be a potential match who works in the same sector. Putting down your hobbies and interest are a great conversation starter so think about what you want to say and enjoy yourself.</p>

The whole point is to entice the user to make the approach of contacting you so you want to make your About Me section not too long or deep remember you want to attract the person not bore them to death! 
<p>Try to avoid writing about what you aren&rsquo;t looking for this can be clearly stated for what you are looking for in the Hashtag describe what you are looking for section which we will cover in the next paragragh. The last thing anyone wants to do is read about you ranting about the so and so losers who contact you or how you make an X amount of lists of pros and cons of what you look for in an ideal partner.</p>
<p>It will only put the reader off as you will only come across as a moaner and negative. Here you want to just simply talk more a little about yourself and your lifestyle to your travel adventures.
