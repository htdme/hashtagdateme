    <meta name="description" content="Sometimes making plans for Valentine&rsquo;s Day can be more hectic then being stuck in a traffic jam! Well fear not here are some top ideas to get you out of that jam and prepared for a memorable day.
Be the chef
Don&rsquo;t worry ladies this one is for the Men who have always enjoyed a home cooked meal made by you. So gentlemen&rsquo;s why not surprise your partner by preparing a romantic dinner made from scratch! Set up the table with decorative rose petals and candles to set the mood and have a glass of wine or champagne ready to toast to an evening of romance. This will sure make your partner feels special and happy for not cooking for a change! Now all you got to decide is who&rsquo;s doing the dishes!
Romantic get away
Valentine&rsquo;s Day doesn&rsquo;t need to be about being indoors or going to a local restaurant. Why not make a date to spend it away on a romantic weekend or weekday! Visit places you both have always wanted to go and once there make a romantic dinner reservation by the sea or in the heart of Venice. Getting away from your busy schedule will give you some alone time with your partner and even bring you closer as you enjoy your trip.
Spa day
Why not indulge yourself and your partner in a day of pampering. Book a couples massage or spa day, you are both bound to feel relaxed and that feeling of not knowing what to do would melt away as you experience a therapeutic massage.
Make a reservation
Romantic dinner reservations are always a safe bet but why not head to a restaurant you both can agree on. Most people have different taste buds than others so why not sit down with your partner and research a restaurant to visit that you both would love to try out. Planning together will give you both some extra time together and something to look forward to on Valentine&rsquo;s Day.
Just you and me
Sometimes doing nothing on Valentine&rsquo;s Day is the best gift you can give each other. Just spending the whole day together with no interruptions can be just as special as going out. Imagine no need to go out or worry about what to do when you can spend the entire day in bed with your loved one.&nbsp; So turn of your phone, tell your friends and family not to come around knocking and just enjoy being in each other&rsquo;s company, total bliss!
Take away in
Not every Valentine&rsquo;s Day needs to be spent slaving over the cooker or worrying about where to go to eat.&nbsp; Ordering in can be made just as romantic as going out for a romantic meal. Simply decorate your dining table with lit candles and flowers maybe even use your finest China to give the feel of romance. Order your favourite take away get a bottle of bubbly and enjoy.
Romantic movie night
This is definitely for the ladies but we are sure guys will love this just as much. Why not spend the evening curled up on the sofa with some popcorn with your loved one whilst enjoying a selection of romantic movies that you both enjoy. A perfect way to end the night.
First date recreated
Nothing screams romance than recreating your first date. Make plans to revisit your first date, think back to where you first met, what restaurant or bar you went to and relive that perfect date. This will lead you both down memory lane and remind you why you are made for each other.
Book a room
Spice up your Valentine&rsquo;s Day by spending the night in a new environment. Change up your normal routine of staying indoors and book a hotel room. Getting out of your comfort zone and away from having to do the cooking or dishes and booking into a hotel will instantly make you feel relaxed and you will have that extra time to just focus on each other.
A day of activity
If you always do the clich&eacute; thing and just reserve the same restaurant then why not try something different. Give your love life a boost by organising an activity you and your partner would love to do together. Get those love endorphins flowing by doing something that will get your heart rate racing from having an exciting day trip to an ice rink or sky diving. Now that&rsquo;s defiantly bound to get your heart racing!
Just remember to have an awesome time! Even though love should be celebrated every day for the entire year, February the 14th is the day you get to just splurge that little bit more!
