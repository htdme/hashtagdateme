    <title>Should A Guy Pay On The First Date • Hashtagdateme</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This is a tough topic that always gets people debating whether a guy should always pay on a first date or that we live in a new era where it shouldn&rsquo;t have to always be that men have to foot the bill. But as a guy it can be hard to know when is appropriate to pay for the bill especially as old fashion ways are always changing. But to help you with this delicate subject here are a few helpful dating advice.
THE FIRST DATE
If you want to gain brownie points start your first date by offering to pay the bill. When it comes to the dating world first impression count. It shows that you have a caring side and are generous, also shows a sense of security some of the traits that women look for in a guy. Of course this does not mean it is written on stone that you should always pay on a date. There are some women who might even offer to pay half the bill but think carefully as she might be just making a small gesture and is just simply impressed by your chivalrous character to pay in the first place.
A FEW DATES LATER
You&rsquo;ve probably had a few more dates and still feel at that awkward stage on discussing if you should go dutch on the bill. You might be still offering to pay as you might feel the need to impress your date. If you feel happy and comfortable enough to do this then do so but if you don&rsquo;t then the best advice is to be open with your date and suggest going 50/50 once you have gotten the first date out of the way. You soon might realise that when things are going really well between you both, you and your date are paying for each whether it&rsquo;s going half on a night out or your date&rsquo;s pays for an event while you pay for the meal.
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE 5TH DATE AND SO ON
By now you are probably at that comfortable stage where you are not even thinking about who pays for what. The formalities should be out of the way now, where you both are happy to pay the bill. When making plans don&rsquo;t worry about discussing money as she will be happy from the thought that you are making future plans and showing an effort in doing things together. This will root into a happy and healthy relationship when setting the tone right from the start. Because leaving things for too long and not bringing up your concern on paying the bill can cause tension in the relationship.
Remember it&rsquo;s not the size of your bank balance that impresses most women but how you are as a person and how you treat them.
