    <meta name="description" content="The taunting idea of writing your first message to someone you like can be nerve racking. Knowing the right thing to write is always an issue for most and can put most people off sending the first message. Worry not here are a few ideas on how to kick-start your confidence onto sending your first perfect message.
Have a complete profile
Before you sum up the courage to send your first message the last thing you want is to have a well thought out message and only to get overlooked because your profile is empty or doesn&rsquo;t say much about you. The general thing most people do after receiving a message is checkout that user&rsquo;s profile, now if they see no effort put into the profile or no photo&rsquo;s this will most likely receive no reply. So make sure to make your profile stand out. Now this doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll always receive a response, but you have more chance than if your profile is incomplete.
Short and simple
The last thing anyone wants to do is read a long essay so keep your message short and simple. No need to bombard your message with one question after another this will leave the person feeling overwhelmed and it can be time consuming to answer 100 questions! Just read your potential matches profile page to see what will be a good conversational starter and pick one or two interesting questions to ask. Keep it short and brief no need to talk loads about yourself and what you like because they are most likely to know all this after checking out your profile. Simply keeping it short and sweet will always leave them wanting more!
Start a conversation
Most conversation starters is asking a question, now that does not mean writing a generic question like &ldquo;Hi, how you doing?&rdquo; this will only prompt a generic reply with &ldquo;Good thanks. Yourself?&rdquo; which only put&rsquo;s you back to square one. You want to standout from rest of the crowd and make your question catch the person&rsquo;s attention. Don&rsquo;t ask questions that will only get a &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo; reply instead ask questions that require more than this cause those are more intriguing to respond to. Look at their interest or hobbies and maybe ask questions best related to them. An example of a question to ask could be &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe you backpacked in Peru. I was there last year too and love it! What was your best thing about your trip?&rdquo; remember do not answer your own question because the next logical thing would be the person will ask you the same question.
Write about them
When sending your first message try not to make it all about you. People love to read about themselves. Show them that you have shown interest in their profile and mention what caught your attention. So if they say something that you don&rsquo;t entirely agree on say it or if they wrote something that got you curious mention it. If it was their deep eye or cheeky smile just say it.
Double check your message
Re-read what you wrote check for any grammar or spelling errors as for some people this can be a deal breaker. So taking that extra few seconds to double check your message you can quickly correct any typo errors.
When it comes to messaging just be yourself. Keep it short and sweet, you&rsquo;ll hopefully soon be on your way to meeting your perfect partner!
