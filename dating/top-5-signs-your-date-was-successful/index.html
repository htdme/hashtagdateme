    <title>Top 5 Signs Your First Date Was Successful â€¢ Hashtagdateme</title>
    <meta name="description" content="So you went on your first date, you feel like you and your date had a good time and you&rsquo;re really hopeful for a second date. Here are 5 essential signs that can give you a good indication that your date was successful and wants to see you again.
Body Language
It is absolutely essential that you can read signs of interest through the use of body language. These body signs are actual manifestions of all the millions of neural chemicals fusing and outputting critical information that will help you decode whether your date is into you.
If your date is fidgety or does not look at you often and is sidetracked on their cell phone this is the biggest clue that they are not into you or perhaps are lacking the attention span to be dating. Bear in mind if someone is fidgety it could simply mean they are nervous or shy.
Eye Contact
Eye contact is essential in any conversations whether it&rsquo;s for a job interview or meeting someone new. There is a common saying that the eyes are the windows to the soul. If your date is directly looking into your eyes and communicating it is easier for you to know if there is a spark. Usually they would stare at you with a soft gaze almost as though they are smiling with their eyes. Eye contact has been known to create attraction and even better that eye contact makes people more honest.
Conversation is fantastic
Conversation is natural flowing and you both communicate with ease. If your date is interested they want to know more about you, expect questions such as plans you may have for the future and absolutely share your own. Your conversations should help you build a rapport. Conversation is like a tennis match, make sure the ball isn&rsquo;t just in your court.
All&rsquo;s well that ends well
Shakespeare was definitely onto something with the phrase &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well&rdquo;. Did your date end well? If your date was all smiles and cheerful throughout and ending the date with a hesitant goodnight could mean your date did not want to end the date so soon.
Follow up text or call for potential second date
This one is a dead giveaway, but your date may not want to immediately tell you that they are interested in a second date and only follow up with a text or phone call. However, if your date communicates back to you after the date whether via text or a phone call this is a definite sign of interest in a second date.
