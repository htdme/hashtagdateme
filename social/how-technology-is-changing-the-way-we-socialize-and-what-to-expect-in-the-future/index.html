    <title>How Technology Is Changing The Way We Socialize And What To Expect In The Future • Hashtagdateme</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Technology is transforming the world rapidly. It is known that a very long time ago seers predicted that in the distant future we will be able to see people moving inside a box. Eons later we have what is now called the TV (Television).
We have come a long way since the invention of the television, and now even Netflix are predicting what watching TV will be like in a decade.
Since the advent of home appliances, from the washing machine to the dishwasher things have been getting incredibly easier for people including developing countries that are now benefitting from technological inventions.
So What Happens When Robots Can Do Things For You?
Now things are about to get even easier.
From driverless vehicles to our very own personal assistant robot customized to our needs it&rsquo;s no doubt the future is transforming. Change is inevitable. And it&rsquo;s all looking very promising. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a massive thing now and it&rsquo;s already happening. Have you met Siri?
Already with self-checkouts in supermarkets and now even self-ordering at restaurants taking over replacing a lot of jobs human tasks we are going to experience less and less human interaction in our everyday lives. With more robots we will have less human interaction, or perhaps not?
Technological advances should have only one goal in mind, to make life a little easier and productive or more so just like the invention of the dishwasher &ndash; have you yet marveled at what these things can do? Companies are already automating every possible task you can perceive and this means some of the most usual jobs being replaced by technology which includes robots and drones. Such a rapid development can only lead to what is known as a Universal Basic Income, where every happy bunny adult is getting a fixed amount of money indefinitely whether he or she decides to work or not.
So what will exactly happen when Robots take over the world replace boring human tasks? Well for one we are definitely going to have less interaction with which we have become accustomed to in common places such as the supermarket, cafes, restaurants, Uber and more.&nbsp; But this does not necessarily mean no human interaction. Finally we are going to have time to make friends, collaborate with people, follow great social causes. It&rsquo;s about time we get to use more of our right hemisphere of the brain, and allow creative minds to come together to create something that a Robot cannot accomplish.
We are social creatures and history will show that humans have always been parts of social gatherings from ancient tribes to great traditions that have passed before us. Hopefully, fingers crossed that we don&rsquo;t see anything like Skynet, robots will serve us by giving more free time to spend with our friends, family and make meaningful connections.
