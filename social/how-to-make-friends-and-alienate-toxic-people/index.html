    <title>How To Make Friends And Alienate Toxic People • Hashtagdateme</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Could the people in our lives be making us sick? It&rsquo;s a great idea for a new years resolution to alienate toxic people and make friends that help you grow.
As humans we are social creatures, even Aquarians who are infamous for their solitude, often need some company. Whether that company is in the form of friends, love interest, family or even our beloved pet as long as it is good companionship it is the best companionship you can have.
However at times in our lives we form relationships that we need to crawl away from for a massive health revamp. For a healthy mind, body and soul it is important to find positive minded people.
Who are toxic people?
Before we start calling people names it is best to declare we are all humans and everyone has experienced some negative phase in their lives. In this case toxic people are people who are not letting you grow and develop with your innate gifts, basically they don&rsquo;t bring out the best in you.
Here are some indicators that will help identify toxic people in your circles:

Negative thinking, they always have something negative to say
They are fixated on the same repetitive subject with a negative attitude
They complain a lot about others
They create a lot of conflict and arguments

How do I alienate toxic people from my life?

Reach out and make new friends
Attend social gatherings and networking
Find what you are interested in and focus on these
Use personal development tools
Mindful meditation
Practice relaxation methods
Eat healthy, a healthy body equals a healthy mind

Be mindful that toxic people are human after all, and they may be having some issues in their own lives. If you can support them in some ways then do so, but this does not necessarily mean you should get tangled in a mess where it will badly affect you. It&rsquo;s important to look out for yourself and part of that is knowing what you want out of life and focusing on things that make you happy whether they are goals, a hobby or project.
Whilst abusive relationships do fall in the category of toxic people, this article is not intended to give advice for abusive relationships. If you are in an abusive relationship it is important to reach out to your local Social Services for help and support.
