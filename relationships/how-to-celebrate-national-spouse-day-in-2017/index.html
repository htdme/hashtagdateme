    <meta name="description" content="How to celebrate National Spouse Day in 2017
It&rsquo;s national spouse day, a special day dedicated to you and your partner. Today is a great reminder to make time for your spouse. It is a great time to appreciate your other half and show them how much you care.
In a fast paced world and with increasingly busy lifestyles it can take a toll on a marriage leaving our partners feeling neglected. Here are some things you can do today to make your spouse feel special and that you care about them:
Write a poem dedicated to your spouse
You don&rsquo;t have to be Rumi to capture the love of your spouse, one of the sweetest thing to do is put your feelings for your spouse in the written word. You can easily use many apps online to create a bespoke poetry with an image as a background to express your feelings. If you are not feeling too poetic simply stick a love note somewhere your partner would look and surprise them.
Go on a date
Reserve a date one that both you and your partner will enjoy, maybe he or she is a real foodie. Explore your area and try something new.
Cook something special
If you&rsquo;re not fancying eating out make a special feast at home together enjoying each other&rsquo;s company. Cook your partners favorite meal or try something new.
Get your partner a gift
Although there is no need to get your partner a gift on National Spouse Day, if you did neglect your anniversary now is the time to make up for it. Get your partner something they&rsquo;ve been wanting for a while, go ahead and surprise them.
Communicate with your partner
It&rsquo;s time to sit back and really enjoy your partners company, share your thoughts and talk about the good times you&rsquo;ve had together.
Relive those early dates
Consider going out on a date you had when you first met. Revive those feelings you had when you first met your partner, try to create the same scene.
Remember the three special words every partner wants to hear
Nothing really beats an &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;. Say it often, if you are texting your partner on this special day make sure to close at least one text message with an &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;.
The partners appreciation list
This is a great game to play with your partner. With a pen and paper at hand, write down everything you appreciate about your partner. Exchange this list with your partners appreciation list and enjoy.
