    <title>10 Top Tips for Surviving New Year’s being single • Hashtagdateme</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Wow could you believe you just survived being single during Christmas and guess what is lurking around the corner? Yes you guessed it, New Year&rsquo;s Eve!! It seemed hard enough having to go through Christmas alone but if you survived that then New Year&rsquo;s Eve is just as easy. Most people want that special someone to share that new year&rsquo;s &lsquo;midnight kiss&rsquo; with and the reality of not having that special someone this year makes you think if there will be another lonely new year&rsquo;s eve next year. Though it can feel more daunting to be alone on New Year&rsquo;s Eve than Valentine&rsquo;s Day a few simple tips can help you banish that feeling of being alone and kick start love for the New Year&hellip;
1. TIME TO MAKE PLANS
If possible try to make plans in advance so you are not panicking last minute on what you can do on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Don&rsquo;t be a potato couch and sit in front of the TV watching the fireworks get your butt off the couch and go and enjoy the beautiful display in person. Even if you leave your plans to last minute don&rsquo;t stress you are sure to find a friend who wants to get off their couch too!
2. DRESS TO IMPRESS
This is the one night you get to go out and let your hair down. So why not express yourself and dress however makes you feel good. As it is the one night you can dress as extravagant as you want. Be bold and maybe even hit a fancy dress party. Doing yourself up will be fun and keep you in a ready to party mood.
3. TREAT YOURSELF
Don&rsquo;t feel that this day is not about yourself. Not every holiday should feel like you need to spend it with a significant other. Take a &lsquo;me day&rsquo; and pamper yourself go to the spa and relax in the Jacuzzi tub or sit back and experience a soothing facial. Whatever will help you unwind and let the worries of the day float away.
4. FIND A GREAT SPOT
When trying to figure out what to do for New Year&rsquo;s Eve the list is endless from events to house parties. No matter where you are there is always something to do on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. So get hold of your friends and check out what is going on in your local venues and what is on.
5. VENTURE OUT
Instead of worrying about being stuck indoors for New Year&rsquo;s Eve why not choose a place you want to visit. Pick somewhere that you have always wanted to visit from spending New Year&rsquo;s in a beautiful lodge to visiting friends or family who live a bit of a distant away. Getting out of the comfort of your own home will do your soul some good and keep your mind occupied from thinking about feeling alone indoors.
6. TRY SOMETHING NEW
Taking up a new hobby or interest will help keep you busy during the holiday period. Find a group or class you can attend and by doing so you will not only learn a new skill but meet others who are also spending the holiday alone. This will be a great opportunity to make new friends and new plans for the New Year!
7. THINK POSITIVE
You want to go into the New Year with positivity so kick aside the negative thinking and embrace being single. Remember that being single does not mean it is end of the world. By dwelling in your thoughts can ruin a perfectly fun night. You need to know you are not alone and that there are others who are single on this celebratory night. So take each day as they come and take control of your mind-set and enjoy being single.
8. STAY AWAY FROM LOVEY DOVEY COUPLES
It&rsquo;s nice when your couple friends want to spend New Year&rsquo;s Eve with you but spending time with your loved up friends will only just remind you of how single you are! Remember it&rsquo;s not a bad thing being single but watching couples in love will only make you feel like it is.
9. MIDNIGHT KISS A FRIEND
The magical midnight kiss when the clock strikes 12 doesn&rsquo;t mean you can only kiss your soul mate and if you don&rsquo;t then your doomed for next year. Kiss a girl friend or a close guy mate, don&rsquo;t feel that you shouldn&rsquo;t join in on the tradition because you are single.
10. DON&rsquo;T STRESS
Don&rsquo;t overthink or stress yourself out in the possibilities of either not getting that New Year&rsquo;s kiss or having that special someone to spend the night with. Enjoy the day and make it a night to remember. You&rsquo;re single that means you&rsquo;re free from any obligations so let loose and have fun.
So as the New Year creeps around the corner try take these into account and just remember that New Year&rsquo;s Eve is overrated and the only thing you will be thinking about the next day is how to get rid of that horrible hangover!
